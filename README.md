# Create a Dostoevsky-like Novel Writing Bot Using Markov Chains

One of my favourite literary figures of all time is Fyodor Dostoevsky. Dostoevsky is a famous Russian 19th century author who has written many famous classics such as *Crime and Punishment* and *The Brothers Karamazov*, being considered one of the fore-runners to existential thought. As such, Dostoevsky is not only discussed in literature, but also very much influential in other fields such as psychology and philosophy. 

Dostoevsky is known for his blackly comical prose, often writing from the perspective from those who are not typically considered "normal" by society. And this is especially the case in his two short novels *White Nights: A Sentimental Story from the Diary of a Dreamer* and *Notes from the Underground*. The first being, as stated, from the perspective of a dreamer who has his head in the clouds and often fantasizes a lot. The latter being from the perspective one an anti-social middle-aged adult who spends his time Underground. As such, Dostoevsky is known for having a distinct writing style, oftentimes emulating those who are seen to be "mad".

In this Data Science project, I hope to mimic such a style using a Bot using Markov Chains. I split those two mentioned short novels above as training data, and given a starting state, it writes in the style of Dostoevsky.
